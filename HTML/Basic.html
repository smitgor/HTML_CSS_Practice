        Truth is the autobiography of Mohandas K. Gandhi, covering his life from early childhood through to 1921.
        It was written in weekly installments and published in his journal Navjivan from 1925 to 1929. Its English
        translation also appeared in installments in his other journal Young India.It was initiated at the insistence
        of Swami Anand and other close co-workers of Gandhi, who encouraged him to explain the background of his public
        campaigns. In 1998, the book was designated as one of the '100 Best Spiritual Books of the 20th Century'
        by a committee of global spiritual and religious authorities.</p>
